# Portfolio
#### A simple website showcasing myself, 11/22/2019
### By Sarah Mwendwa
## Description
This project is my personal portfolio, it has a list of some projects I have done as well as my education background and work experience, as well as my hobbies and interests. Something like a CV but it's a website. It also has links at the footer to my social sites. Don't hesitate to take a look.

## Technologies Used
Apart from HTML and CSS, I also incorporated a tiny little bit of JavaScript to make a cool looking top navigation bar.
