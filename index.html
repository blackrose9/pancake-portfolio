            <article>
               <p>My name is <em>Sarah Mwendwa</em> I decided to take the programming class because I felt I had so much more to offer but I had a limited skill set and attending Moringa was the best way to attain this skill set along with getting more insight into how the world of technology works. BUt truly if you ask me, my main goal is to become a bomb developer!</p>

               <h3>School Management System</h3>
               <p>This project was one of my first projects when I entered software development.</p>
               <p>It is a simple Console application written in C# that is meant to help the admissions office of a school register students and assign them to classes. Other features include checking if their fees are paid or not, thus determine a student's exam eligibility.</p>

               <p>To say that I am obsessed with my cat would be a gross understatement. This project focuses completely on my pet and apart from displaying her cuteness, it also shows proper HTML formatting.</p>

               <p>This is a basic HTML website created under the guidance of Moringa School, it has two pages. The first describing what I am yet to learn and the second page describing my favorite things. And not to forget a picture of an elephant :)</p>
